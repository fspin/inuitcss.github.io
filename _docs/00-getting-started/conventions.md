inuitcss relies on a handful of conventions which might be useful to know about
when you work with our framework.

## Namespaces

You may have stumbled upon the “odd” way inuitcss’ classes are prefixed. There are three different namespaces directly relevant to inuitcss:

* `.o-`: Objects
* `.c-`: Components
* `.u-`: Utilities

In short: Every class in either of these three directories gets the appropriate prefix in its classname. All of inuitcss’ classes in one of these three layers has this kind of prefix. Be sure to follow this convention in your own code as well to keep a consistent naming convention across your code base.

If you want to dive deeper into namespacing classes and want to know why this is a great idea, have a look at [this article](http://csswizardry.com/2015/03/more-transparent-ui-code-with-namespaces/).
