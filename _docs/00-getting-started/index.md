Get started with inuitcss.

## Installation

You can use inuitcss in your project by installing it using a package manager
(recommended):

**npm:**

```
$ npm install inuitcss --save
```

**yarn:**

```
$ yarn add inuitcss
```

**Bower:**

```
$ bower install inuitcss --save
```

**Copy/paste (not recommended):**

You can download inuitcss and save it into your projectâ€™s `css/` directory.
This method is not recommended because you lose the ability to easily and
quickly manage and update inuitcss as a dependency.
