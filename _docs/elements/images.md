{% include file-info.html %}

By including the `_elements.images.scss` file, you make your images fluid by default, i.e. they shrink in size as the viewport gets smaller. 

However, if your images have explicitly assigned a `width` or `height` attribute, they keep their initial size (i.e. defined by their `width` and/or `height` attribute). If you don't have any control over these attributes (e.g. when they get generated by a CMS), but still want your images to be fluid, you can set the `$inuit-static-images` flag to `false`:

```scss
$inuit-static-images: false !default;
```
